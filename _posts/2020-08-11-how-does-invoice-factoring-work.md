<p>If you use invoicing to manage customer payments, you need
to know about the opportunity factoring offers for invoice management. As one
of the world's oldest forms of financing, it's a relatively simple arrangement.
Factors buy your invoices off your books, assuming responsibility for
collecting payment from your customers. Historically, this has been used for
everything from advance sales of farm produce and trade goods to the sale of
debt, which is the more modern version of it. The best part is that since you
are selling the invoices to someone else for collection, you aren't taking out
debt. Instead, you're accepting a payment that is below face value for the
privilege of closing out the bill.</p>

<h2>Why Sell Invoices?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lot of businesses who rely on invoicing and billing
customers instead of taking cash on delivery find that over time, some
customers take advantage of the process. Leaving the balance unpaid past the
end of the grace period means leaving your incoming cash short when you still
have payment obligations to your own suppliers, and factoring is a way of
sidestepping that issue. For companies that use it frequently for old invoices,
the costs become predictable enough that they can be folded into quotes for
customers who frequently wind up having invoices sent to a factor. The process
puts cash in your hands fast, without increasing your debt, and it also takes
work off your accounts people so they don't have to keep chasing customers for
payment.</p>

<h2>Do You Have To Factor All Your Invoices at Once?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Different factors have different terms, so it's worth taking
the time to find one that offers you the options you want. That being said,
there are trade-offs. Those that want to purchase all your outstanding invoices
at once typically do so to mitigate the risk of having a few that don't pay. As
a result, they tend to offer a little more for them than the companies who will
let you factor select invoices. That's why factors review the customers you
have invoices for and their payment histories, too. Typically, the more likely
the customer will repay shortly after the invoices are sold, the better the
rate you get for them.</p>

<h2>When To Use Factoring</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most companies will wait to sell invoices until they need
the money due to cash flow demands, but not always. Factoring selected invoices
from customers with troubled payment histories might simply be the cost of
doing business with certain firms, and if that's the case, then you will want
to fold in the expense of calling in a factor when you quote your services to
those customers. It's also worth considering an occasional arrangement just to
give yourself a clean slate when you have a lot of invoices out, so you can
start fresh with a simpler invoicing landscape.</p>
