<p>Financing the acquisition of new equipment is challenging
for many small businesses. This is true regardless of the type of business that
needs new equipment. For those who don’t have the capital to fund this
purchase, a viable option is equipment financing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, there are some business owners who avoid this
simply because they don’t understand what benefits it offers. If you find
yourself in this group, keep reading. Here you can learn more about equipment
financing and the potential benefits it offers.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Flexible Solutions</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The different types of financing solutions that an equipment
finance company offers, especially the leases, are flexible and can be tailored
to the specific tax, cash flow, or accounting needs. You can find options that
run the gamut from capped FMV (fair market value) leases and FMV lease
transactions to a full payout loan.</p>

<p><strong>Capital Preservation</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The preservation of capital is an important consideration
for most businesses that have made equipment financing an appealing option. If
you were to invest in large capital expenditure, this represents a huge
financial risk – especially if you have a smaller business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Financing, instead of spending your cash, and particularly
the financing type that is used (i.e., lease rather than the loan), helps to
reduce the uncertainty of investing your capital asset that may not provide you
with the desired return. For example, you can receive lease payments that match
the productivity of the equipment in question.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Improved Expense
Planning</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consistent budgeting and being able to maintain your cash
flow are other factors to think about. Rather than having to use significant
amounts of your capital, which results in significant budget fluctuations, with
financing you can easily plan your expenses. At this point, there are certain
tax considerations that come into play, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you payout your lease or your equipment loan, it lets
you take depreciation on the asset you have acquired, and the operating or the
FMV lease lets the borrower receive lower payments and no depreciation. With
the loan, you can lock the payments in for the life of the equipment or asset,
and a lease offers a lower expense for the expected use time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to equipment financing, there are more than a
few factors to keep in mind. If you want to make the decision that is right for
your business, be sure to keep the benefits listed here in mind. Doing so will
help you secure the equipment you need without having to spend too much of your
business’s invaluable capital.</p>
