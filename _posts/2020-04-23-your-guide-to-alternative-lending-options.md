<p>Alternative lending is a viable option for small business
owners who have been denied traditional bank loans and other traditional loan
products. The term “alternative lender” refers to several lending models. Keep
reading to learn about some of the most popular and commonly used alternative
lending methods here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Direct Private
Lenders</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A direct private lender uses its own money to issue loans,
instead of relying on investors or depositors. This allows the direct private
lender to be more flexible in approving applications. These lenders offer
diverse loan types, including bridge loans and asset-backed loans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, these lenders are more flexible regarding the money
provided by each approved loan. Many of these lenders offer lower-value loans
that some conventional financial institutions won’t even consider.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Marketplace Lenders</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Commonly referred to as peer-to-peer lenders, these
individuals will leverage online platforms to work around banks and to connect
borrowers directly with investors. Even though banks offer loans from the money
that’s been deposited, a marketplace lender just packages loans from investors,
delivering the funds to the borrower, collecting fees and commissions to make
money. A marketplace lender will usually decide if they will award the loan
based on the current credit rating of the borrower.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Crowdfunding
Platforms</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A crowdfunding platform is a popular option for businesses
in the startup or prototype stage. This platform offers borrowers a place to
raise smaller amounts of money from a larger number of people. Usually, the
borrower will set a goal and then market their campaign to appeal to a possible
investor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The biggest benefit offered by crowdfunding is that it can
help to eliminate the application process. Keep in mind, with this method,
success isn’t guaranteed. The end result is dependent on how well the campaign
is marketed and how many people invest in the cause.</p>

<p><strong>Is Alternative
Lending a Smart Option for You?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

venture and you cannot secure traditional financing from a bank or credit
union, now is the time to consider the alternative lending options mentioned
here. Each of these offers a viable, and often easier, way to get the funds
needed to start or grow a business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Research the options carefully to find the ones that best
suit your needs and the goals of your business. Doing so will pay off and help
ensure you get the desired results for your business growth efforts.</p>
