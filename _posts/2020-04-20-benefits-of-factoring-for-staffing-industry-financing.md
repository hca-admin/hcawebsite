<p>Every business needs access to capital to help pay for
various operating expenses. If you are in the staffing industry, you may want
to consider factoring. This form of financing gives you money now for your
outstanding invoices. As you likely know, waiting for customers to pay up can
be a source of serious strain. There are many great benefits to factoring for
staffing industry financing.</p>

<p><strong>1) Opportunity to
Invest in Growth</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Getting money now for your accounts receivable can give you
the opportunity to invest in your business’s growth. You don’t need to wait for
your customers to settle their balances. Instead, you can start that new
marketing initiative or hire new people. The reliable cash flow from factoring
gives you a chance to grow your business more steadily.</p>

<p><strong>2) Achieve Consistent
Cash Flow</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The staffing industry is notorious for late payments on
invoices. When you give your customers time to pay, it can put a strain on your
cash flow. Unfortunately, your expenses and other financial obligations don’t
go away just because your customers are being slow to pay. Fortunately,
factoring can help you to achieve more consistent cash flow.</p>

<p><strong>3) Favorable Terms</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In many cases, you can get better terms on financing than
with a traditional loan. You are borrowing against your invoices. Therefore,
the factor has an asset to collect on. That can help you to get superior terms
than you would otherwise qualify for.</p>

<p><strong>4) Help With
Collection</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is in the factor’s interest to collect from your
customers. That is where the repayment of the advance comes from. So, in many
cases, you can get some back-office support from your factoring company. You
won’t be alone trying to collect your accounts receivable anymore. If you run a
small staffing agency, the added weight of your lender can help a lot.</p>

<p><strong>5) Fast and Easy</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Factoring is a very fast and simple solution for getting
capital for your business. You are simply selling an asset to the factoring
company. This means that there is far less documentation needed and the
approval process is faster. If your customers have good credit, you will almost
certainly be approved. It is the simpler way to get money.</p>
