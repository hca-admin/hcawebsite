<h2>Claim the Benefits of Our Stated Income Commercial Real Estate Program</h2>
Did you know it’s easier than you may realize to get a loan for your business? Even if you’ve had bad luck applying for loans in the past, Hill Capital Advisors can probably help. We offer a stated income commercial real estate loan that’s possible to qualify for even if your credit score isn’t the best. If you’re certain the value of the property in question is sufficient to cover the associated taxes, mortgage and insurance, your loan approval chances are quite high.
<h3>Loan Details</h3>
Here are a few details you should know about our stated income commercial real estate loans:
<ul>
 	<li>You’ll need a minimum credit score of 600</li>
 	<li>You can use the funds for anything your business needs, including refinancing, purchasing property or even consolidating debt</li>
 	<li>You can receive up to 75% loan-to-value if you’re purchasing mixed use or multifamily properties that have at least five units</li>
 	<li>We’ll need to see proof of self-employment or W-2 documentation</li>
 	<li>Our loans offer terms up to 25 years and fixed rates</li>
</ul>
It doesn’t matter what type of property you deal in. We commonly provide stated income loans for everything from apartments to restaurants. As long as you meet our minimum qualifications, we can offer the financing you need for the property in question.
<h3>Why You Should Consider a State Income Loan</h3>
Unlike a traditional loan, a stated income loan is not as strict when it comes to your credit score. Additionally, you don’t have to fill out as much paperwork with a stated income loan as you do with a regular loan, and approvals are much quicker to receive.
