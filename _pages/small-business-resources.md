<h2>New! Business Credit Builder &amp; Financing Program</h2>
Here at Hill Capital Advisors, we receive numerous calls a day from people that are looking to start a business or trying to get unsecured financing for their small business.  This can be a daunting task for many, due to their own personal credit history.  What most don't realize, is that your company also has credit profiles that can be built up in a manner as to which you no longer need to rely on your own personal credit profile to obtain business financing.  Unlike personal credit; however, business credit is more difficult to establish and to build up to that point.

We are currently offering a new program that will help you in the following areas:
<ol>
 	<li>Establish your company officially (help you with how to file LLC or Inc for your business)</li>
 	<li>Obtain your EIN (your company's identification number)</li>
 	<li>Set up basic business resources
<ol>
 	<li>Website</li>
 	<li>Phone numbers</li>
 	<li>Fax number</li>
 	<li>Virtual address if needed</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Establish your company's business credit profile with the major reporting agencies</li>
 	<li>Begin building up your business' credit with each agency</li>
 	<li>Establish tier-1 vendor credit lines</li>
 	<li>Establish tier-2 vendor credit lines</li>
 	<li>Establish unsecured revolving credit lines (true business credit cards that don't report to your personal credit profile)</li>
</ol>
The goal of all of this is to help you build up your business and it's credit history to the point that you can obtain financing for your business without having to rely on your own personal credit.
