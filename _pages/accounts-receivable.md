<h2>It’s Time to Consider Accounts Receivable Financing for Your Business</h2>
Did you know you can sell your outstanding receivable invoices in exchange for cash right now? At Hill Capital Advisors, we encourage businesses to take advantage of our accounts receivable program, which provides a convenient way to get the money you need without taking on more bank debt. If you currently have any customers that regularly take a long time to pay (up to 90 days or more), this program may be exactly what you need.
<h3>Program Details</h3>
Our program is very straightforward and easy to understand. You simply sell us any accounts receivable invoices you want to sell for a discounted rate, and we pay you for them within 24 hours. You’ll no longer need to deal with collecting on those accounts, and you’ll also have instant cash to use however you want. Here are additional program details:
<ul>
 	<li>Funding that increases in conjunction with your sales and receivables</li>
 	<li>No-cost credit insurance for all accounts that qualify</li>
 	<li>No recourse or personal guarantees</li>
 	<li>No need to make fixed monthly payments</li>
</ul>
When you receive funding through our financing receivables program, you’ll have a greater ability to fulfill large orders on time and pay for all your operating expenses. You’ll also have an improved ability to meet seasonal demands and take advantage of opportunities for growth.
