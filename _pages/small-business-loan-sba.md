<h2>Financing for Small Businesses</h2>
At Hill Capital Advisors we understand the special challenges that small businesses face. That's why a small business loan from us is a smart choice for your business financing. We are a Preferred Financial Services company, approved by the Small Business Administration. This gives us the ability to process your SBA loan efficiently, without wasting any of your time.
<h3>Existing Business Acquisition Loans</h3>
For SBA existing business acquisition loan approval, we look at how well your business is managed. We want to see a good cash flow and sound management policies in place. These amortized loans typically have financing of up to 80 percent and terms of 15 years. There are no prepayment penalties. Get prequalified in as little as 48 hours.
