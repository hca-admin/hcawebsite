Here at Hill Capital Advisors, we receive numerous calls a day from people that are looking to start a business or trying to get unsecured financing for their small business.&nbsp; This can be a daunting task for many, due to their own personal credit history.&nbsp; What most don’t realize, is that your company also has credit profiles that can be built up in a manner as to which you no longer need to rely on your own personal credit profile to obtain business financing.&nbsp; Unlike personal credit; however, business credit is more difficult to establish and to build up to that point.&nbsp; As with personal credit, this process takes some time and effort, but is often a last resort for many with poor personal credit.

<strong>We are currently offering a new program that will help you in the following areas:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Establish your company officially (help you with how to file LLC or Inc for your business)</li>
 	<li>Obtain your EIN (your company’s identification number)</li>
 	<li>Set up basic business resources
<ol>
 	<li>Website</li>
 	<li>Phone numbers</li>
 	<li>Fax number</li>
 	<li>Virtual address if needed</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Establish your company’s business credit profile with the major reporting agencies</li>
 	<li>Begin building up your business’ credit with each agency</li>
