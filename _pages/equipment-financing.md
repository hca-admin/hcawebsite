<h2>Learn Why Financing Your Equipment May Be Better Than Buying It Up Front</h2>
No matter what industry you’re in or what type of business you own, you probably rely on equipment to get things done. As you expand, you’ll most likely need to acquire even more equipment than you currently have. If you attempt to pay the full cost of the equipment you need all at once, you could end up using up all your working capital and decreasing your financial flexibility. Fortunately, Hill Capital Advisors can help keep this from happening. Our equipment financing program is popular among businesses of all sizes. If you qualify, you could gain access to all the equipment you need while paying for it slowly over time.
<h3>How Our Programs Work</h3>
We have several attractive equipment leasing and financing solutions that you may want to consider. They include the following:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Second Chance Credit: </strong>Are you embarrassed by your current credit score? Not to worry! We regularly accept B, C and even D credit through our Second Chance program. We understand that a single economic downturn can have catastrophic and long-term repercussions on your credit profile, and we want to help you get back on your feet.</li>
 	<li><strong>Startup Programs:</strong> We’re exceptionally generous when it comes to offering loans to small businesses. If you’re a startup that’s less than two years old, ask us about our startup equipment financing program.</li>
 	<li><strong>Government and Municipal Programs:</strong> Did you know we guarantee financing to government and municipal programs that need equipment? That’s right, you don’t have to question whether or not you’ll be approved if you represent a fire house, federal government agency, or any other federal or state agency.</li>
 	<li><strong>Sale and Lease Back Program:</strong> Do you ever wish you could sell your equipment for instant cash while still maintaining full use of the equipment? Now you can! We offer a sale and lease back program that gives you cash right away for selling us your equipment. Then, you can lease it right back from us.</li>
</ul>
We’d love to tell you more about any of these programs. Give us a call today and let us know what questions you have.
